## Game Flow

1. Birth, given 3 stores to work at
2. Start taking orders
3. Restate order to confirm correctness (a receipt)
4. Store calculates price
5. Register presents change due
6. User inputs correct coins/bills
7. Register checks if correct
8. Display success / error message
    - success = happy points
    - error = happy deductions
9. Order complete
    - Depending on happy points = tips
